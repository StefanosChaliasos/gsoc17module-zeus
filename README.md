Implementation of a New Re-encryption Mix-net for Zeus
======================================================

As mentioned in various papers and deliverables the mix-net used in Zeus is not
sufficient. This module will replace the current mix-net implementation in
favor of a faster one.


Deliverables
============

On GSoC we will aim to:

1. Experiment with the existing mix-net implementation on Zeus.
2. Identify which of the existing mix-net publications are
   fit to be implemented.
3. Implement a new re-encryption mix-net prototype.
4. Test the prototype and deploy to production.
